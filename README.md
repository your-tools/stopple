# Stopple

Find and plug security issues in your dependencies

## How it works

You give stopple a list of all your dependencies (usually, by reading them from a lock file),
and it looks for vulnerabilites online (for instance, by using the NVD API)

Then, it displays a report for you and tell you what dependencies you need to upgrade.
